# Draw
Draw project is my University Vector Graphic Application with multiple functionalities. There are shapes that can be resized, colored, rotate, and delete.
The workplace can be clear and saved with a specific format after that every user can open its workplace and continue work on it. The start project is from Alexander Penev - Associate Professor in the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the Plovdiv University "Paisii Hilendarski".
